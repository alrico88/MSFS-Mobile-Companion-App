## How do I install MSFS Mobile Companion App?
1. Download the latest build [here](https://github.com/mracko/MSFS-Mobile-Companion-App/releases/tag/1.1).
2. That's it.

## How do I run MSFS Mobile Companion App?
1. Make sure your PC and your mobile device are connected to the same local network and that your home network is set to *Private* in your Network Profile settings. 
2. Start a flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
3. Run MSFS_MCA_v1-1.exe that you've unzipped previously.
4. A Microsoft Defender security window may open when launching MSFS_MCA_v1-1.exe for the first time. Allow the "unrecognized app" to run. Additionally, a Windows Security Alert Window may open when you launch MSFS_MCA_v1-1.exe for the first time. Allow private network access for MSFS_MCA_v1-1.exe in the Windows Security Alert Window.
5. A command line window will open that will give you instructions on the IP-address where you can access the MSFS Mobile Companion App. Don't close the command line window.
6. Open the IP-address in your mobile device's web browser. The IP address will most likely be something like *192.168.0.XXX:4000*.

*Notice: You can launch MSFS Mobile Companion App directly from your PC's browser. In that case, just type in localhost:4000 in your browser's url bar.* 

## Known issues:
- NAV frequencies can get out of sync, especially when rapidly pressing frequency adjustment buttons. Use the "Force Sync Frequencies" button to synchronize frequencies with the sim.
- NAV frequencies are not automatically synchronized when starting a second flight. Use the "Force Sync Frequencies" button to synchronize frequencies with the sim.
- CDI switch doesn't work in 747, A320 and CJ4.
- MSFS Mobile Companion App may crash when accessing it from multiple devices at once.
- May not work on some older devices/browsers (ie iPad 2 has been reported as having issues).
